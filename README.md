# Video Game Sales Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook contains data analysis on video game sales from 2018-2023, organized into several sections:

- [Dataset Description](#dataset-description)
- [Data Exploration](#data-exploration)
- [Data Preprocessing](#data-preprocessing)
- [Statistical Analysis](#statistical-analysis)
- [Key Findings](#key-findings)
- [Insights](#insights)

## Data Exploration

In this section, I explore the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the data and uncover any potential issues or insights:

- **Columns with Null Values:** Inspected columns containing null values to decide on appropriate handling methods.
- **Dispersion and Central Tendency:** Analyzed statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
- **Skewness and Kurtosis:** Examined skewness and kurtosis to understand the shape of the data distribution.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Used a correlation matrix to analyze relationships between numerical columns.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to visually represent data relationships.

## Data Preprocessing

In the data preprocessing phase, I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis:

- **Label Encoding:** Applied label encoding to convert categorical columns into numerical format.
- **Removal of Irrelevant Columns:** Removed columns deemed irrelevant to the analysis to enhance data clarity.
- **Handling Null Values:** Filled numerical columns with null values using their corresponding medians to maintain data integrity.

## Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis section focuses on validating hypotheses and understanding statistical relationships within the data:

- **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted hypothesis tests to validate assumptions and analyze results.
- **Chi-Squared Test for Independence:** Implemented chi-squared tests to examine relationships between categorical variables.
- **Independent T-Tests:** Performed independent t-tests to compare means across different groups.
- **Paired T-Tests:** Conducted paired t-tests for dependent samples to identify significant differences.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Calculated confidence intervals for numerical columns to estimate population parameters.

## Key Findings

In this section, I summarize the key findings from the data analysis.

## Insights

Based on the analysis, several insights have been derived.
